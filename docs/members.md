WCPO would like to acknowledge the contributions to our AUC from our clinical users and the Image Learning Network (ILN).

## Conflict of Interest Policy

The WCPO follows Conflict of Interest (COI) process for each member of our AUC panels and leadership teams, each member is periodically sent an electronic COI form, WCPO maintains a record of panelists’ COI responses. If a panelist has a conflict that member is expected to recuse themselves from any development or recommendations specific to an AUC.

A Conflict of Interest is defined as any actual or potential compensation and/or financial/other tangible benefits related to the AUC or the domain of the AUC for the individual or the individual’s family relatives. Relatives is further defined as “spouse, domestic partner, ancestors, brothers and sisters (whereby whole or half-blood), children (whether natural or adopted), grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and the spouses of brothers, sisters, children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.” This COI is in accordance with our institutional compliance policy. Contact [tsj9003@med.cornell.edu](mailto:tsj9003@med.cornell.edu) for information on Conflicts of Interest.

No Conflicts of Interest Reported.
